it ’ s always easier to say something than to do it .,commissive,no emotion,64
"it ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .",directive,no emotion,64
but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans .,commissive,no emotion,64

it ’ s a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes .,commissive,no emotion,64
"you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .",directive,no emotion,64
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .,commissive,no emotion,64
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .,directive,no emotion,64
