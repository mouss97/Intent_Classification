g|you're certainly above it right|acknowledge
f|uh-huh|reply_y
g|okay right come eh vertically down to just below the word banana tree|instruct
f|okay|acknowledge
g|now ehm since this obstacle is missing eh we can either go down and follow the exact same path as they've gone or we can go across to the rope bridge and down there ehm|instruct
g|just wondering i suppose i ought to keep it the same as what they've got|explain
g|so ehm come down 'til you're just below the level of the word rope bridge eh just a vertical line straight down just draw it straight down|instruct

g|oh no you should be y--|reply_n
f|it's above it's well my tree might be different than your tree|explain
g|okay|acknowledge
g|well just just|ready
g|go to the right about an inch and then draw an "x" and we'll be done|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
g|i got to see your map|explain

f|no|reply_n
f|no-- it's just allotments to the eh right|explain
g|no|acknowledge

g|stop just at the bot-- the top right corner of the allotments just above that little shed|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
g|then you move in an angle slo-- sloping slightly upwards to approximately a third of the way across the page from the right and stop|instruct
f|so what is this eh there's a flight museum here on the|query_w
g|it's not marked on my map|reply_w
f|oh right|acknowledge
f|ehm it's eh on the same level as the start position basically|explain
g|slightly below approximately on level with the top of the camera shop|instruct
f|right|acknowledge
f|so you make an angle and that's a straight line|check
g|a straight line yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge

g|yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
g|curving around the top of the disused monastery|clarify
f|yeah right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
f|so curve around the disused monastery then where|query_w

f|right|acknowledge
f|could you just say that again|query_w
g|right from the disused monastery the left-hand side of disused monastery the curve makes a dip rather than a rise a trough|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
g|and stops level with the left-hand side of the alpine garden|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|so it's a a curve eh pointing upwards to get to the disused monastery|check
g|no|reply_n
g|a curve poin-- going down the way uh|clarify
f|that's what i mean|explain
f|i mean eh the apex of the curve is higher than the two base points basically|check
g|yes|reply_y
f|right|acknowledge
f|and then a the reverse of the concavity of the thing to come round to the alpine garden|check
g|yeah|reply_y
g|you stop on a level with the m-- disused monastery to slightly to the left of the alpine garden|clarify
f|right|acknowledge
f|right|ready
g|then you go up vertically 'til just above the alpine garden|instruct
g|then you mak-- go right to the end of the alpine garden|instruct
