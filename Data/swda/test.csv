uh , i would say the majority of it 's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
most ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
but why ?	qw	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
why is it happening ?	qw	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
well , most families , most families are young	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
and both people are working .	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
so they 're happening during the hours they 're gone from work .	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh , so , uh , i would say that 's probably their prime motivation .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
they 'll , they 'll stock your house and , uh , look at your pattern and then go from there .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
so they 're professionals ?	qy^d	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh , they classify most of them as professionals .	na	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
um .	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh , you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier , uh , just taking , uh , you know , just junk items that they , they can just get , you know , ten to twenty bucks for real quick .	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
probably the biggest items that , uh , that you get in our neighborhood , or , would be the high classed automobiles ,	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
the , you know , mercedes , volvos , things that they can get , you know , big dollars for --	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836

very few , you know , penny , penny ante stuff .	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
well , what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ?	qw	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
well , uh , the police force , for one ,	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
i think they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh , it 's ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
oh , right now i think , we are about thirty thousand people	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836

uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
for that amount of people --	+	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
-- which is not very many .	+	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
right .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
and ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
but , i mean , that 's going to tend to ,	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher ,	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
in other words , you 've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
well , the ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever ,	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836

right .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
they 're doing that in our state , too .	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
yeah ,	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
and , and it 's ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences , uh ,	sd	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
but for the ,	%	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
so you think that would be a deterrent ?	qy_qr	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
that would be , certainly be a deterrent .	na	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh-huh .	b	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
and , uh , not necessarily , you know , give in to their , uh , human rights desires .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
you know , if they 're overcrowded , just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate . uh ,	ad	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
well , what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ?	qw	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
uh , i think they 'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person 's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
course , i , i know you ca n't be a hundred percent foolproof .	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836

i mean , i , i tend to agree with you .	aa	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836
i think , uh , what i would like to see is , number one , completely getting rid of these victimless crimes . uh , there 's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it --	sv_fx	1255	1087	CRIME	818	sw2836

takes two weeks for that system to process , uh , your request for , uh , not as a gun permit but , uh , but to buy ammunition .	sd	1033	1019	GUN CONTROL	820	sw2434

maybe putting a week 's waiting period or something on it .	+	1033	1019	GUN CONTROL	820	sw2434

i usually only go about a mile or two .	sd	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229

yeah ,	b	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229

very important .	+	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229
yeah .	b	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229
i found that ,	sd	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229
but ,	%	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229
true especially from walking on toe and fronts .	+	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229

i get into that for , for a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile ,	sd	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229
but then i 'll get tired of doing that ,	sd	1139	1075	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	822	sw2229

right .	aa	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
well and , uh , you know , one thing my wife and i 've talked about , i , are , uh , private schools .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
yeah .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
you know whether , uh , uh , we would want to invest in , in private schools as they 're g , growing up , because , you know , just in the dallas area , um , we 're not real comfortable with the , with the public schools .	+	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
and dallas , uh , school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
right .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
i could n't believe that .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
right .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
you know , one , that 's one reason we bought a house here in plano .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
we were hoping , you know , well the school district 's going to be good , you know , for resale value , and ,	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
yeah .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
so on and so forth ,	+	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
but , uh , i can definitely , uh , see on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that 's going to be a definite concern .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
yeah ,	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
we talked , you talked about before , about the school funding .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
i think there 's only going to be one solution to school funding which i do n't think will be necessarily the best way	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
but i think what 's going to have to happen is there 's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
that 's the only way they 're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , and people are going to throw a fit .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
that 's ,	%	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
yeah ,	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
and , you know , that 's ,	%	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
taxes right now are political suicide .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

you know ,	+	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
and i do n't think any politician 's going to do that ,	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
so .	%	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

and the only thing , they , they would think of would be tuition , you know ,	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
if it works at colleges it will work down below .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
right .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

exactly .	aa	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

i ca n't believe that .	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

r- , right .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
i mean , i 'd , i 'd be afraid to be in school , i mean b , teaching , or even being a student	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

what 's going to happen ?	qh	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

right .	aa	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
but there again , you ca n't hold them back .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
another reason , yo- ,	%	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
and you want to encourage them , you know , to , to be active and everything in school ,	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
but , uh , you know , with all the peer pressure that 's going on , with all the negative things , it is , uh , it 's a tough environment to be growing up in .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
yeah ,	aa	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

well i was , i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine ,	sd	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
so .	%	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
okay .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
that was what , twelve years ago , i guess .	qy^d	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
right .	na	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
so , you know , it 's lot different now .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

but , uh , i do n't know ,	h	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
i , i guess what you have to do is just , uh , keep in , uh , you know , encouraging them and , and , uh , uh , try to be open with them , so that y- , you can deal with the problems as they come up .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
that 's all you can do .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

you got to , you got to be your child 's best friend , i guess ,	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
right .	b	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
even when they 're a teenager and they , you know are kind of standoffish ,	+	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

that 's right .	aa	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
and , and the schools do n't , do n't really encourage to stay away from that , you know ,	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war , etcetera , etcetera .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
they do n't teach them good values like drugs are bad .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461
i , maybe i 'm wrong , because i have n't , you know , been in that kind of environment for a long time ,	h	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

it just is amazing , you know ,	+	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

of course , wh- , if i say this is a good value , someone else is going to stand up and say , oh no .	sv_fx	1146	1102	PUBLIC EDUCATION	823	sw2461

well , that 's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article .	arp_nd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
so that ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
oh , they did n't say , they did n't say what though ,	bf	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
they just said they thought it was ,	fo_o_fw_by_bc_"	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
they did n't say what ,	na	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

uh , natural disease ,	bf	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

but , um , i do n't know ,	h	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i mean , what do you think we can , uh , i guess as individuals or as a group , do about , uh , air pollution ? .	qw	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh , we can demand , uh , more efficient automobiles for one thing .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i still think that 's , that 's , uh , one of our major causes of pollutants .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh-huh .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh , how we go about that , it 's uh , uh , it 's a little bit difficult .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i think it 's up to individuals too , to ask automakers for ,	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
for less pollutant vehicles .	+	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

uh , if you can get those types of groups .	+	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem .	qy_qr	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i mean , i remember reading an article that said like , it 's , uh , the older polluters ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
the , the twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

of the automobile pollution	+	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

yeah ,	aa	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
they 're better ,	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there .	qh	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh , when was the last time you saw a truck that did n't belch , smoke , or , uh ,	qw	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but does n't that just mean they 're out of tune .	qy_qr	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh , i 'm not really sure .	no	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
you think that , that , that the , uh , the trucking indus- , industry is that , uh , incompetent , that they would n't , you know ,	qy^d	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
fuel is , is one of their biggest costs .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
right .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
so , you would ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but diesel engines .	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
diesel engines .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
it , you know , it 's , it ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i mean , they do generate a lot of soot	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

yeah .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
we could also , uh , push for legislation for , uh , rapid transit systems .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
this country seems to be a little behind on that .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
on the other hand most people do n't use rapid transit because it 's so inconvenient .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
um , yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but only because we got used to , uh , single person , single car ,	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

uh-huh .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i guess canada 's quite concerned that we 're sending a lot of our stuff up there ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
sure .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
so that 's helping .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
well , what do you think about like a device , a meter right on a tail pipe	qw	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted ?	fo_o_fw_by_bc_"	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
now that 's an idea .	ba_fe	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
do n't say that too loud though because , uh , every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue ,	ad	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
well , it just means if you do n't pollute , right , or you pollute very little you do n't have to pay any tax	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
or you just buy one of these things	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and it , it , uh ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
maybe you , you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and , uh , the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and you could n't start your car anymore .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
that 's a , that 's an interesting concept .	ba_fe	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
is that your idea ?	qy_qr	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	ny	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but , uh , you know , it 's , uh ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i guess the difficulty would be to , that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
well i was going to say ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
right .	aa	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
you could put it in , you could , you could , it could be installed like a catalytic converter .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
right .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i mean i guess you could take those off too	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
you could take ca- ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	aa	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
if you can take a muffler off and only replace ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
well not unless it was built into every muffler .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
right .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and that 's mumblex .	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
had to pay a pollution tax , uh , this would penalize the heavy polluters and not penalize the light polluters ,	+	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
that 's a , that 's quite a concept .	ba_fe	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
you should , uh , pursue that i think , or patent it , you know .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	aa	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
patent it ,	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
that 's a good idea .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
if you could come up with a device that 's the thing .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
right .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but it should n't be too hard to do something like that .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but that 's a , that 's a thought .	sd	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
no ,	%	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh-huh .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
you 're right	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
and that will solve , uh , a lot of problems .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
i do n't know if you , uh , if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh-huh .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , i guess the proper authorities ,	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
uh-huh .	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
well you might , uh , generate some --	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
yeah ,	b	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
the automobile regulatory agencies or something .	bf	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

you might generate some interest in it .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
but that 's , that 's a good idea .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121
other than that i 'm not sure what , what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization .	sv_fx	1121	1087	AIR POLLUTION	824	sw2121

she , you know , lost all her activity	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503

so i took his suggestion	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and i , uh , took the , the dog to a hospital . the dog hospital there	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and they said they 'd keep her there for three days .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
well , she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
it cost me over five hundred dollars .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
ouch .	ba_fe	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
plus , the , the , uh , the vet sent me a bill for what he did	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and , uh , then she recouped .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
she was okay for a couple of years .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and then she got sick on me again	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and i brought her to a different vet this time	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and , uh , he gave me the medication , the same medication that i gave her the last time	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and she was okay	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503

yeah .	b	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
well , the , see the problem is if , if the , if someone would have came up to me and said it 's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
what do you want to do ?	^q	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503

yeah .	aa	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
of course , you would .	aa	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
but what they , well , what they do is , is they say , well it 's going to cost , you know , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and , and , you know , and it creeps up on you .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503

and , uh , the cat got sick .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
so she took the cat to the vet	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and she had the cat there for two days	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and then the cat died .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
so the doctor had called her up and said , uh , your cat died	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and you owe me this bill ,	^q	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and oh , by the way , do you want me to , to bury the cat .	^q	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
so , it cost her three hundred dollars , uh ,	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and she did n't get the cat back .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
so , yeah ,	%	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
they had to pay for all the medical , uh , bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503
and , uh , you know , she just brought the cat in because he was n't feeling good .	sd	1019	1050	PETS	825	sw2503

uh , basically , uh , i work on a campus	sd	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the , uh , campus to the , uh , gym , use the shower there --	sd	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
uh-huh .	b	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724

right .	b	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
uh , and sometimes longer if you had adverse wind . and then another half an hour , you know to cool down and take a shower and all this kind of stuff .	+	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
it was a big hunk , hunk of the day .	sd	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
uh , and then of course another hour to get back home .	sd	1237	1087	EXERCISE AND FITNESS	827	sw2724
